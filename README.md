# Codename project Manhattan

This is private repo for the next big online io game.

## Quickstart

1. Install node.js
2. Run a console, and browse to the root folder.
3. Run nmp to start the server: "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" start

## TODO list:
- server authority validation (move, powerup)
- bug: quickly pressing top left while going right will make the player switch from right to left. this is unintended.
- visual effect related to teleport
- possible memory leak server side.
