# Codename project Manhattan

This is private repo for the next big online io game.

## Quickstart

1. Install node.js
2. Run a console, and browse to the root folder.
3. Run nmp to start the server: "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" start

## TODO list:
 - players shouldn't instantly die
 - players should die when they hit a wall
 - When a player dies, the trail disapears (turns into xp nodes)
 - player disconnect = player dead.
 UI features:
 - xp bar
 - health bar
 - level (next to name?)
Gameplay features:
 - spawn little xp nodes on the map
 - attribute system
 - skill system

Attribute and skill ideas:

Defensive stat : +1 hp per point, unlocks the following skills:
 - plasma shield invicibility / destroys everything. 1 charge, 10 sec recharge
 - repair (restores hp over time)

offsensive stat: don't know what this does yet (maybe have a button to do something cool that improves with this)
 - mines
 - missles (blows up players and walls AoE)

utility: don't know what this does either.
 - blink (teleport forward)
 - ghost mode (you can go through wall for a short time)
 - recall (activate once to set a position, twice to teleport to that position (with short invisibility)
