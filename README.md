This is private repo for the next big online io game.

3. Run nmp to start the server: "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" start

## TODO list:

Q: how should collision work when you grow?

- powerup system
- on turn, wipe out all phantoms in a 3x3 neiborhood (maybe not necessary)
- large players are a bit too slow (not sure about that either)
- +xp much more powerful powerups

- test with high lag
- large LOS gray areas to indicate you're too far to see over there
- eliminated, eliminated by messages 
- client jitter when losing points
- wasad to move
- visual effect related to powerups
- large screen doesn't load everything
- phone support
- onscreen explanation of powerups (maybe tips on deaths?)
- player limit
