# Codename project Manhattan

This is private repo for the next big online io game.

## Quickstart

1. Install node.js
2. Run a console, and browse to the root folder.
3. Run nmp to start the server: "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" start

## TODO list:
 - leaderboard : display a list of the top 10 players in the room at all times in the top right corner of the screen. score = gathered xp nodes.
 - teleport skill: when space bar is pressed, the player teleports forward (10 squares?) and clears everything in a 20 bloc radius around the arrival point. A player cannot teleport outside.
 - fix keyboard controls (sometimes feels unresponsive)
 - fix mouse controls: use mouse move (if mouse left pressed) test on touchscreen
 - possible memory leak server side.
