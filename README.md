# Codename project Manhattan

This is private repo for the next big online io game.

## Quickstart

1. Install node.js
2. Run a console, and browse to the root folder.
3. Run nmp to start the server: "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" start

## TODO list:



powerups 4/4:
green: After teleporting, you channel a beam on a nearby player in attempt to steal his color.
red: The next wall you hit will trigger a clearing effect, as well as your teleport cooldown.
orange: Your teleport clearing effect can now kill other players
yellow: Your teleport clearing effect now also removes nearby power ups.
blue: After teleporting, you also clear blocks in a small radius for a short duration upond lading.
purple: After teleporting, you channel a beam on a nearby player in attempt to steal a large number of points.


- wasad to move
- phone support
- if desync is a problem, force resync on client (instead of kicking)**
- also teleport seems to be glitched (cuases out of sync).

- test with high lag
- onscreen explanation of powerups (maybe tips on deaths?)

- player limit
- server crash message
- broad cast restart countdown with custom message
- reconnect support
- crash logs

- add fun combos (teleport modifiers)
- on turn, wipe out all phantoms in a 3x3 neiborhood (maybe not necessary)
