# Codename project Manhattan

This is private repo for the next big online io game.

## Quickstart

1. Install node.js
2. Run a console, and browse to the root folder.
3. Run nmp to start the server: "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" start

## TODO list:


- if desync is a problem, force resync on client (instead of kicking)**

- space down: show teleport area (red X?), space up: teleport! (not 100% sure, needs testing)

- wasad to move
- phone support
- also teleport seems to be glitched (cuases out of sync).
- test with high lag

- player limit
- server crash message
- broad cast restart countdown with custom message
- reconnect support
- crash logs

- add fun combos (teleport modifiers)
- on turn, wipe out all phantoms in a 3x3 neiborhood (maybe not necessary)
