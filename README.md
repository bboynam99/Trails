<p>Use <b>spacebar</b> to <b>teleport</b> and avoid obstacles, or <b>tap</b> the center of the screen.<br /> Teleporting will also <b>clear blocks</b> around the landing area.<br /> This will trigger a short <b>cooldown</b> (black bar below your name).</p>

<p><b>Crashing</b> into other trails will eliminate you.</p>

<p>Your <b>own trail</b> will not eliminate you right away, but will cause you<br /> to lose points until you run out of points and lose.</p>

<p>Gain points by <b>surviving</b> as long as possible. <br /> As you gain points, you <b>grow</b> in size, but also move progressively <b>slower</b>.</p>

## Quickstart

1. Install node.js
2. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the root folder.
3. Run nmp to start the server. (on windows use "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" start)

### todo
- Quick Escape does not trigger (instant death)
- doomsday needs countdown.
- can't see other people's power ups??
- bulldozer blade needs a timer
- bulldozer blade tigger its effect if picked up with CD is still up
- can't see behind lazer beam. Clearing blocks should be instant
- doomsday: should have a timeout. everyone should be able to live.
- entrenchement should have holes (it's too strong)
- points powered air bags do not work well.
