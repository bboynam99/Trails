# Codename project Manhattan

This is private repo for the next big online io game.

## Quickstart

1. Install node.js
2. Run a console, and browse to the root folder.
3. Run nmp to start the server: "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" start

## TODO list:
- Assign colors intelligently: on spawn, assigned a unique unused color, ideally different visually different than the colors in use.
- server authority validation (move, powerup, cooldowns)
- possible memory leak server side.
- visual effect related to teleport
- better cooldown tracking
- bug: quickly pressing top left while going right will make the player switch from right to left. this is unintended.
