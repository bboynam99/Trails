# Codename project Manhattan

This is private repo for the next big online io game.

## Quickstart

1. Install node.js
2. Run a console, and browse to the root folder.
3. Run nmp to start the server: "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" start

## TODO list:



powerups 4/4:
green: upond landing, channel to take someone's color, allowing you to freely move on their trail.
red: upond landing, channel to steal points
orange: your aoe effect now kills other players
yellow: also clears power up on ground upond lading.
blue: Allows you to clear other blocks in a short radius for a short duration upond lading.
purple: next wall you hit will cause an aoe clearing effect, and will consume a red charge


- wasad to move
- phone support
- if desync is a problem, force resynch on client (instead of kicking)

- test with high lag
- onscreen explanation of powerups (maybe tips on deaths?)

- player limit
- server crash message
- broad cast restart countdown with custom message
- reconnect support
- crash logs

- add fun combos (teleport modifiers)
- on turn, wipe out all phantoms in a 3x3 neiborhood (maybe not necessary)
